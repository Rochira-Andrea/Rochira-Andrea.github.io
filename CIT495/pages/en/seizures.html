            <p>When I started investigating this topic, I thought that the words seizures and epilepsy were synonyms. Well, they are not necessarily related. Whatever the case is, understanding the basics can only be beneficial. <br> <i class="emphasis">Seizures</i> are individual occurrences of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They are triggered when the signals running through the nerve cells is altered or interrupted. <br> <i class="emphasis">Epilepsy</i>, on the other hand, is a chronic neurologic disorder that causes repeated seizure activity. <br> Therefore, one seizure alone doesn’t mean that one has epilepsy, but if they keep coming, that may indicate the presence of a disorder that results into epilepsy.
            </p>

            <p>Seizures can actually fall into two macro categories:
                <li>
                    <ul><i class="emphasis">nonepileptic</i>, if triggered by situations not related to epilepsy, such as fever, head injuries, alcohol or drug withdrawal, very high blood pressure, stroke, and so on;</ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul><i class="emphasis">epileptic</i>, if linked to a chronic disorder such as an abnormal growth of blood vessels involving the brain. This category of seizures appears to be a common finding in patients with SWS type 1 and 3.</ul>
                </li>
            </p>
            
            <p>The following table provides a basic classification of seizure types:</p>

            <p>
                An <i class="emphasis">aware</i> onset describes a seizure instance in which the person is awake and aware during the seizure. <br>
                An <i class="emphasis">impaired awareness</i> onset differs in that the person is confused or their awareness is affected in some way.

            </p>

            <p>Familiarizing with the following terms will help understand further the characteristics of a seizure:
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <i class="emphasis">tonic</i> indicates muscles stiffening.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <i class="emphasis">atonic</i> refers to muscles going limp.
                    </ul>
                </li>  
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <i class="emphasis">myoclonic</i> describes quick jerking movements.
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <i class="emphasis">clonic</i> refers to repeated periods of shaking or jerking movements.
                    </ul>
                </li>  
            </p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">SWS and seizures</h2>
            
            <p>Seizures in babies with SWS are usually <i class="emphasis">focal</i>. Generally speaking, focal seizures can be divided in 3 groups:</p>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <i class="emphasis">simple focal</i>, when just a small part of the brain is affected thus generating minimal symptoms (such as a small twitch).
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <i class="emphasis">complex focal</i>, when multiple areas of the brain are affected thus causing confusion, disorientation, or inability to respond from a few seconds to a few minutes.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <i class="emphasis">secondary generalized</i>, when they begin as a focal occurrence in one part of the brain and then progress to a generalized seizure (they are defined secondary since they trigger as a consequence of a primary cause).
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </p>

            <p>When it comes to SWS, focal seizures happen to be more like twitching of the hand or the foot, the eye deviated toward one side and bouncing, one side of the mouth drawn to the side and twitching. In some instances, the head can turn on one side while one side of the body is shaking. A more rare kind is like spasm, a sudden jerk forward of the head and upper body.</p>

            <p>Now, there are some <i class="emphasis">crucial considerations</i> to make. Because of their nature, focal seizures could be very hard to spot, particularly at night and particularly if the parents don't have a clue about what to expect. They could be completely unaware, even for weeks, that their little one is indeed having seizures. They could observe their baby getting pale and throwing up, and think about it as the result of some undigested food. They could be woken up at night by a crying inconsolable baby and think that it was only a bad nightmare. But that's the point: those could well be symptomatic manifestations of focal seizures. So, how can parents discern?</p>

            <p>I'd like to have a clearcut answer to this question, but all I can offer is just a heartfelt advice based on my personal experience. If on a side it's true that seizures can be indisputably detected only by an EEG device, on the other side it's also true that seizures typically alter the vitals, often drammatically, and an <i class="emphasis">information-gathering device</i> can make a huge difference with detecting something off, as it did for my son. And although we cannot wire a little one to an EEG device 24/7, we can surely have them put other kinds of wearable devices on.</p>
                
            <p>There are two key vitals that can be affected by a seizure: heart rate and oxygen levels. The normal range of the former vital varies according to the age. The latter one is measured as a percentage value, which should range between 95% and 100% to be considered normal unless there are other conditions.<br>
            When a focal seizure occurs, the oxygen levels typically drop while the heart rate spikes up to compensate. If something like this happens at night, there is no way for parents to realize what is going on. And that's exactly when an information-gathering device can be extremely useful since the very first week of life.
            </p>

            <p>The extra value offered by this kind of devices is the sleep patterns tracking. When it comes to seizures, being able to track the sleep quality can help determine the need of possible adjustments. Actually, very poor sleep quality or prolongued sleep deprivation is one of the major triggers of seizures (together with skipping seizure medications and high fevers) thus, having an overview of the sleeping trend is just as good as keeping the other vitals under check. </p>

            <p>Here are some of the best devices available out there:

                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <a href="https://neebomonitor.com" class="anchor_no_dec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="emphasisTwo"><i>Neebo Monitor</i><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt smaller"></i></span></a> - this device is excellent in many ways; it can be worn night and day, indoor and outdoor, and supports a flexible placement (anckle, wrist, or upper arm), all features that are difficult to find in one single appliance;
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <a href="https://owletcare.com" class="anchor_no_dec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="emphasisTwo"><i>Owlet Smart Sock</i><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt smaller"></i></span></a><span> - this is the device that my son has been wearing since he was 7 months old and that, one year later, detected the drop in oxygen levels under 80% due to seizures and alerted us in the middle of the night; it has a couple of limitations though: it cannot be worn unless the baby is sleeping or napping, and it can be placed only on one of the feet;</span>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
            </p>    

            <h2 class="section-heading">Stats and Treatments</h2>

            <p>In terms of blood flow and metabolism, SWS tends to stabilize around four to five years of age, up until the puberty, when the body experiences another big change and can trigger new issues. <br> Let's look up some statistics:

                <li>
                    <ul>
                        75% of patients with brain involvement will have onset of their seizures within one year of life
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <ul>
                       85%-90% within two years of life
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <ul>
                        10% or so after two years of age
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </p>

            <p>
            It's impossible to predict what are the odds for our little ones. The reality is that it can happen anytime during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (even late age and for the first time!).
            </p>

            <p>Epilepsy is treated with anti-seizure medications. There’s no one best treatment for everyone. Most frequently, SWS patients require a couple of seizure medications plus a <span class="emphasis">low dose aspirin</span> to control their seizures. A smaller number of patients have seizures easier to control while another small number have seizures very difficult to control (thus requiring alternative seizures medications or even a surgical intervention). <br> The goal of medication is complete seizure control to decrease chances of cognitive or neurological decline.</p>

            <p>Some of the most popular medications, known for their efficacy with focal seizures, are: Levetiracetam (or Keppra), Lacosamide (or Vimpat), and Oxcarbazepine (or Trileptal), all belonging to the category of the narrow-spectrum anti-epilectic drugs (used to treat or prevent seizures that occur in a specific part of the brain on a regular basis).</p>

            <p>Let's spend a couple of words more on the <i>low dose aspirin</i>. As odd as it may sound, the most common analgesic used for pain relief is also used to prevent (to some extent) some types of seizures and stroke-like episodes. Why? Because aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, is also a blood thinner. Studies have shown a reduction in both self-reported seizure frequency and stroke-like episodes after starting aspirin. A low dose aspirin is very safe, although not 100% safe. On one side there’s a very low chance of allergic reaction. On the other side, since it thins the blood a little bit, if the baby is involved in a fall or accident, he would be expected to bleed more. <br> Neurologists may prescribe it as a preventative medication when there's evidence or suspicion (due to the risk factors) of brain involvement.</p>   
 
            <blockquote class="blockquote">In rare instances, some patients can even come off of seizure medications later in childhood.</blockquote>

            <p>Another important aspect to consider, and not underestimate when it comes to babies and seizure medications, is that <span class="emphasis">the amount of medicine is strictly related to the baby’s weight</span>. Since they tend to grow quite a lot during their first years of life, it’s important to recalculate the dosage on every increase of 5 to 6 pounds. If babies are kept on the same dosage for too long, such as 9 months or 1 year, it’s very likely, if not certain, that they will start seizing again. The ratio considered for the dosage recalculation is 1 mg per 1 kg.</p>
